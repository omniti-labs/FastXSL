    Option                  Description
    ------------------      --------------------------------------------------
    fastxsl.shmpath         
                            The path to key your shared memory segment off of.
                            Depending on which mm implementation you use, this
                            path may or may not need to be creatable.
                            (DEFAULT: "/tmp/fastxsl_mem")

    fastxsl.nostat          
                            Whether or not to check xsl files to determine
                            if they are changed.  If this is set to '1',
                            then xsl changes will not be picked up until
                            the server is restarted.
                            (DEFAULT: 0)

    fastxsl.memalloc        
                            The amount of shared memory to allocate to 
                            FastXSL for caching stylesheets.  If this is
                            set to 0, FastXSL will allocate as much memory
                            as libmm will permit it to.
                            (DEFAULT: 0)
 
    fastxsl.register_functions
                            Whether or not to register the PHP extension
                            namespace and allow users to use PHP functions
                            as XSLT extension functions.
                            (DEFAULT: 0)


EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
==================

float fastxsl_version()
                            Returns the version number of the FastXSL library.

resource fastxsl_xml_parsefile(string filename)
                            Parses the filename in question and returns it
                            as a FastXSL XML document resource.

resource fastxsl_xml_parsestring(string str)
                            Parses the string in question and returns it
                            as a FastXSL XML document resource.

resource fastxsl_shmcache_transform(string xsl, resource xmldoc [, array params])
                            Apply the XSL stylesheet given by 'xsl' to the xml
                            document resource given by xmldoc, with optional
                            XSL params.  The compiled stylesheet will be 
                            cached in shared memory.  Returns a FastXSL 
                            result resource.

resource fastxsl_prmcache_transform(string xsl, resource xmldoc [, array params])
                            Apply the XSL stylesheet given by 'xsl' to the xml
                            document resource given by xmldoc, with optional
                            XSL params.  The compiled stylesheet will be 
                            cached in process-local memory.  Because of the
                            large amount of memory libxslt uses, use of
                            the prm functions is discouraged.  Returns a
                            FastXSL result resource.

resource fastxsl_nocache_transform(string xsl, resource xmldoc [, array params])
                            Apply the XSL stylesheet given by 'xsl' to the xml
                            document resource given by xmldoc, with optional
                            XSL params.  The compiled stylesheet will be 
                            not be cached.  Returns a FastXSL result resource.

string fastxsl_shmcache_tostring(string xsl, resource fastxsl_result)
                           Takes a stylesheet and a result resource and
                           returns the transformed document.  This must
                           be used with resources created with 
                           fastxsl_shmcache_transform().

string fastxsl_prmcache_tostring(string xsl, resource fastxsl_result)
                           Takes a stylesheet and a result resource and
                           returns the transformed document.  This must
                           be used with resources created with 
                           fastxsl_prmcache_transform().

string fastxsl_nocache_tostring(string xsl, resource fastxsl_result)
                           Takes a stylesheet and a result resource and
                           returns the transformed document.  This must
                           be used with resources created with 
                           fastxsl_nocache_transform().
                            
array fastxsl_shmcache_getstatistics()
                           Returns an array of statistics regarding what
                           data is cached and how much space it is consuming.
